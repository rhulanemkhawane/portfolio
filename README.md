# [Project 1: Academic Paper Assessing the Determinants of Child Hunger] (https://github.com/rhulanemkhawane/portfolio/blob/main/Research%20Project%20on%20Child%20Hunger.docx)
**The overall purpose of this paper was to determine the factors that effected child hunger. 
The results of this paper were limited to the variables used in the data set provided. 
Child hunger is a complex topic with many different determinants that go beyond the variables 
included in the data set. There were several single and multiple regression models run with 
variables relating to child hunger. Previous literature research was used to determine several 
of these variables. This paper found that variables relating to early childhood development 
centres were mostly significant, as well as race and household income. Variables such as gender 
and number of people living in a house were also significant. Age and whether the person in the 
family received a UIF were insignificant variables. The coeffecient of determination of the 
main full model was 22%. The main recommended policy relates to the investment into ECDâ€™s.**
